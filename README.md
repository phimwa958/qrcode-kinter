# qrcode kinter
 qrcode kinter

I use kinter to create a program to create qr code and decode qr code

Similar to the qrcode program The original that I created But this time there is a gui

ps. I don't know how well it works. Because I am a visually impaired person and using kinter for me is very difficult, but it runs without any problems and has options. Just like I created I think it'll be okay lol
